# Stochastic Simulations - Samples and Statistics

## Motivation:
Generally, its not enough to use only one or a few points to represent a specific distribution. Samples and statistics are most widely used tools to analyse the distribution features. Various statistical parametrs denote the different characteristics of distributions. The commonly used parameters are sample mean and sample variance which denote the avaerage value and spread of raw data respectively. There are also several paramters that shows the relationship between two or more sample sequences, such as covariance which denote the correlation between observation sequences and interval estimates such as % confidence intervals etc.

## Uniform Sampling
   - Histogram of the outcomes
   - Comparison with theoretical
   - Mean, Variance, Bootstrap Confidence Intervals, Correlations
   
## Sampling with Replacement
  - Histogram of the outcomes
  - statistical goodness of fit test at 95% confidence level
